MRS-Client

This module is a SOAP-based (Web Services) client that can talk, and
get data from an "MRS server", a search engine for biological and
medical databanks that searches well over a terabyte of indexed
text. See details about MRS and its author Maarten Hekkelman in
"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS" of "perldoc MRS::Client".

Because this module is only a client, you need an MRS server
running. You can install your own (see details in the MRS
distribution), or you need to know a site that runs it. By default,
this module contacts the MRS server at CMBI (http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/).
